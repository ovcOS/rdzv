## Rendezvous

An app that helps people to choose the best place to meet.

It can be challenging to select a place for friends to meet up when everyone is living in different parts of the city. With this app, `Rendezvous`, we solve the challenge by generating the optimal location for friends to meet up given their real-time locations, with the goal to select the most central place for everyone. This project integrates with Google Map API and uses real-life transportation data and geographical data to generate intelligent solution that benefits all.
